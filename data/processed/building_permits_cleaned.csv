At this time, I just want a demo permit that allows us to remove items inside the house only and place them in a dumpster.  I have sent an email that includes the updated bond, COI and my updated license information.    ***PURSUANT TO ORDINANCE NO 2008-1263 of the Metropolitan Code of Laws, I , holder of this permit, hereby certify that all construction and demolition waste generated by any and all activities governed by this permit shall be disposed of in an approved landfill.  Further, I certify that no construction or demolition waste shall be stored on the property in violation of any provisions of the Metropolitan Code. For every 30 feet of street frontage, or fraction thereof, one 2 inch caliper tree as listed in the Urban Forestry approved tree list shall be planted on the subject property.   For every 50 feet of site frontage, a double-sided sign 24” x 36” in size must be posted in English and Spanish that contains the information required by Ordinance No. 2017-835.
